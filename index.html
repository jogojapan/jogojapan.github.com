  <div class="entry-content"><p>Natural language processing has become big. Almost every university
employs at least a few researchers specializing in it, almost every
major internet company hires NLP specialists to help analyse the
natural language part of &#8220;big data&#8221;, and hundreds of workshops and
conferences are held every year.</p>

<p>Its methods have changed, too: Several decades ago, ideas based on
mathematical logic dominated the <em>semantic analysis</em>, and ideas based
on phrase structure grammars dominated the <em>syntactic
analysis</em>. However, for the past ten years or so, statistical machine
learning and large-scale corpus studies have dominated the field.</p>

<p>This blog is dedicated to its own variety of natural language
processing. Its principles are different from those of today&#8217;s
mainstream NLP, and they are different from most (though probably not
all) of the NLP and computational linguistics of the past. The key
elements are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lexeme-specific rules:</strong> The syntax of a language is described
using rules, but there are far more rules than in traditional
phrase structure grammars, and there are many rules that apply to a
single lexeme only.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Structural analogy:</strong> Sentence structures that cannot be analysed
using existing rules are analysed in the same way as sentences that
are structurally <em>similar</em> or <em>analogous</em>. This notion of
structural analogy will be defined in terms of predetermined
transformation rules as well as approximate (fuzzy) matching
against corpora of example sentences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactive refinement:</strong> The formal description of the grammar
(lexeme-specific rules, transformation rules and other elements) is
created iteratively by testing intermediate stages against large
corpora. To this end, a specialized corpus query system (CQS) is
used.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>A lot of this is still very unclear. I started my activities by
creating a CQS, and doing this involved a significant amount of
research into the architecture of search engines, and the data
structures and algorithms they use.</p>

<p>This blog is going to describe my approach to NLP as it evolves, and
it will do so in great detail. I&#8217;ll start with the CQS, which I
decided to re-implement from scratch. I&#8217;ll blog about my choice of
algorithms and implementation strategies, as well as specific &ndash;
and sometimes very minor &ndash; programming techniques as I rebuild
the CQS. This alone will take many months, perhaps more than a year.</p>

<p>I have also started to work on the definition of the lexeme-specific
rule framework and prototypical designs for a parser. Posts related to
this will start to appear in the blog soon, perhaps in a few weeks or
months from now. Over time, the focus will gradually shift from string
algorithms and implementation strategies towards grammar description
and linguistics, and the blog title, <em>Algorithms on Strings</em>, will be
increasingly</p>

<p>My programming language is C++ (C++11 and a lot of Boost), and the
operating system is Linux. The hardware I use includes both
Intel-based PCs and large Xeon-based servers with tens of CPU cores
and 1 TB of RAM.</p>
